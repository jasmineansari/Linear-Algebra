# Linear-Algebra
Undertook a meticulous data refinement endeavor, implementing sophisticated linear algebra techniques. Leveraged the Singular Value  Decomposition (SVD) function with finesse, addressing missing values with precision.

## Data Exploration
1. The notebook starts by importing the necessary libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
2. It then reads in a dataset from a CSV file called 'GTPvar.csv' and stores it in a Pandas DataFrame called 'data'.
3. The `data.head()` function is used to display the first few rows of the DataFrame, which shows that it contains 5 features (X1, X2, X3, X4, X5).
4. The `data.describe()` function is used to compute summary statistics for the features, such as the count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values.
5. The size of the dataset is checked using `len(data)` and `data.shape`, which show that there are 100 rows and 5 columns.

## Correlation Analysis
6. The `data.corr()` function is used to compute the correlation matrix, which shows the pairwise correlations between the features.
7. The correlation matrix is then visualized using a heatmap created with the `sns.heatmap()` function from the Seaborn library.

## Missing Data Handling
8. The notebook likely includes additional code (not shown in the provided search results) to identify and handle any missing data in the dataset. This could involve techniques such as dropping rows with missing values or imputing missing values using appropriate methods.

## Linear Algebra Operations
9. Based on the name of the notebook, it is likely that the code includes demonstrations of various linear algebra operations, such as matrix multiplication, vector operations, eigenvalue decomposition, and other fundamental linear algebra concepts. These operations are likely applied to the dataset to extract insights or perform further analysis.

## Machine Learning Algorithms
10. The notebook may also include the application of machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, principal component analysis, or other techniques that leverage linear algebra principles to model the relationships in the data.
